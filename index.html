 <h2 id="Experience">Experience</h2>
 <p>
     Life is a trial, it gives you opportunities to either strive unto what you want, or give up
     incase it defeats you. But this does not mean you give up, try as much as you can for the good.
     <br /><br />
           <div style="background-color:aquamarine">
               The purpose of life is to live it, taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and
               without fear for newer and richer experience. I have been in a situation in which I didn't
               know what to do...I know also it needed me to make a choice between the two. But because of the
               intelligence we are in-built with by the Most HigH God, He was able to pave way for me.

     We all have dreams. We dream,strive and strive before we achieve success but we discover this
     along the way that jouney is more important than destination you only realise this in the step
     called "GROWING"
     <br /><br />
     Growing means learning. We face challenges in different perspectives. Take an example of weather.
     When it is hot, people respond to stimuli differently. One may choose takin a shower,
     the other resting under a shade. The way everyone responds is totally different from
     another's.
     <br /><br />
     So life hits one differentlybut it is out of experience that you can vindicate how it goes.
